# Mobile

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 22.2.2.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

## Local measurement synchronization

From the repository root, start the local API and Angular in separate terminals:

```text
dotnet run --project backend/src/Lueftlotse.Api
npm --prefix mobile start
```

The Angular development proxy forwards `/api/**` to `http://127.0.0.1:5045`.
The API stays on loopback; no CORS or Android cleartext changes are required.
Restart `ng serve` after editing `proxy.conf.json`.

API base URLs are configured in
`src/app/features/air-monitor/data-access/measurement-api.config.ts`.
The browser uses `/api`. Native builds have no configured server (`nativeBaseUrl: null`)
and disable synchronization; the phone's localhost is not the development computer.

Open **Synchronisierung** and choose **Jetzt synchronisieren** to send pending
measurements, grouped by device and source, with at most 100 per request.
The run uses a fixed local key boundary so newly collected measurements wait for
the next manual run. Confirmed packets are marked synced in IndexedDB without
deleting history. Lost or invalid responses leave the packet pending; a later
manual retry sends the same measurement IDs and accepts server duplicates.
Errors stop the run; earlier confirmed packets remain synced. There are no
automatic retries. IndexedDB v3 adds a sync-status index while retaining v1/v2
history, primary keys, assigned IDs, metadata migration progress and simulator identity.
